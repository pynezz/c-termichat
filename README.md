# c-termichat

*WIP*

## A Secure* chat application client written in C

Termichat is a WIP hobby / self-study project for expanding my knowledge in C beyond the school classes.

### Idea
The idea is to have a chat application working in the terminal to better live up to the image our prof 
painted by saying every Linux user operates mainly in the terminal. Unfortunately Discord does not work in the terminal.
This application aims to fix the issue of having to use a resource intensive GUI for chatting, 
and by reinventing the wheel, I will hopefully learn something along the way. 

### Stack
 - Websockets (libwebsockets)
 - OpenSSL (asymmetric encryption)
